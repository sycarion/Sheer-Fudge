# Sheer Fudge

>There comes Poe, with his Raven, like Barnaby Rudge,  
Three fifths of him genius and **two fifths sheer fudge**,  
Who talks like a book of iambs and pentameters,  
In a way to make people of common sense damn metres,  
Who has written some things quite the best of their kind,  
But the heart somehow seems all squeezed out by the mind.

James Russell Lowell

This is one of the more famous quotes of fireside poet James Russell. I actually have a very different opinion of Poe, but this quote fits the premise of this repo. I'd like to think that my rendering of the of the second edition of the world's most popular role-playing game is at least 60% genius. However, given that getting the actual rules is inexpensive, I am well aware that this is closer to 40% sheer fudge at a minimum. This repo represents the way I would run 2e now. It is more than house rules, so I decided to publish the rules to see if anyone else would find them useful.

## What Sheer Fudge Is

Sheer Fudge is a less fiddly version of the 2e rules I own along with some new subsystems. I hope there might be one of two things that folks find useful.

Some notable items include:
* THAC0
* Roll-under Attribute for all non-weapon proficiencies, skills, Rogue abilities, and psionics
* A psionics combat system inspired by The Will and the Way
* My OGL pantheon to generate Priests of Different Mythoi.
* Kits as fun possibilities, not min/maxing.
* Streamlined character options and skills.
* Alternate cosmology for fantasy space travel.
* An alternative to class limits for non-humans.
* Ancestry/Culture used as an alternative to race.

### Background

I spent almost 100 hours of prep time for a game that never happened. The request was for a 2e game that was mostly rules as written. Discussions with one of the players, though, showed that the desire for kits and systems that are not entirely compatible. For example, there are two different psionic systems, one with Mental Armor Class/Mental Thac0 and one that is not. I had to figure out how to merge the two systems to have something without MAC/MTHAC0.

I also discovered that 2e was quite fiddly with pages of modifiers. In my games in high school and college, I don't remember having a five panel GM screen just to have them all handy. Maybe I had internalized them back then, but I really wanted something more straightforward for running this game. When I run older RPGs, I tend toward games based on B/X rules where the rules get out of the way.

Still, I was also struck by the similarities with the current edition. 2e feels like an early draft of 5e, especially when it comes to character options and the number of settings. I had originally thought I could use some aspects of 5e to make running the game easier. I discovered, though, that 2e was too wild to be constrained by bounded accuracy. I hope that my variation doesn't domesticate the game too much. I hope to run it one day as this project represents a different type of fun that is equal parts nostalgia and straightforward.
