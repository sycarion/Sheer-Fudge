# Sheer Fudge

>There comes Poe, with his Raven, like Barnaby Rudge,
Three fifths of him genius and two fifths sheer fudge,
Who talks like a book of iambs and pentameters,
In a way to make people of common sense damn metres,
Who has written some things quite the best of their kind,
But the heart somehow seems all squeezed out by the mind.

James Russell Lowell

I did a lot of prep for a 2e game that never materialized. During the prep, I was struck by how baroque the 2e ruleset actually was. I loved all the settings and gleefully embraced Spelljammer to tie them all together. In my cobbled-together set of rules, I didn't have all the extras that 2e provided.
I was also struck by the similarities with 5e. I can't put my finger on the defining aspect that triggered this in me, so all I can say is that it feels like an early draft of 5e.
So with all this documentation, I decided to just publish what I have as is to see if anyone can use it.
## What Sheer Fudge Is

Sheer Fudge is a simplified version of the 2e rules I own, plus some systems I used years ago. Some notable changes include:
I use THAC0
Roll-under Attribute for all non-weapon proficiencies, skills, and psionics
A psionics system that is a hybrid of the two offered in 2e
Priests of Different Mythoi details
Kits that are intended to be less OP
Not nearly as many individual skills. Many are similar to 5e like Profession (Fishing) instead of listing all the professions as separate skills.
